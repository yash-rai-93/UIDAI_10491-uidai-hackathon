Unlike Neural Networks, it does not require complex normalization for these geographic IDs, making it faster and more accurate for tabular time-series data.Specific Focus: The code loads only the Biometric Model because the objective here is Logistics Planning. Biometric updates (Iris/Fingerprint) require physical machines and queues. Predicting \"Server Load\" (Demographics) is irrelevant for physical staffing; we need to predict \"Footfall,\" which is the specific function of the Biometric model.\n",

The code specifically performs a \"Time Shift Operation\":Current Week's Actual Count $\\rightarrow$ becomes $\\rightarrow$ Next Week's Lag_1 Feature.Without this historical dataset, the model would have no inputs to generate a prediction."
